'''
A constructor is a special method in a class used to create and 
initialize an object of a class. There are different types of constructors. 
Constructor is invoked automatically when an object of a class is created.

A constructor is a unique function that gets called automatically 
when an object is created of a class. The main purpose of a constructor 
is to initialize or assign values to the data members of that class. 
It cannot return any value other than None.

        print("Hello I am Haron. How are you?") #this will be printed even if we merely just create object

# Parameterized Constructor in Python
# When the constructor accepts arguments along with self, it is known as parameterized constructor.
# These arguments can be used inside the class to assign the values to the data members.

class Details:
    def __init__(self, animal, group):
        self.animal = animal
        self.group = group

obj1 = Details("Crab", "Crustaceans")
print(obj1.animal, "belongs to the", obj1.group, "group.")

# Default Constructor in Python
# When the constructor doesn't accept any arguments from the object and has only one argument, 
# self, in the constructor, it is known as a Default constructor.

  def __init__(self):
    print("animal Crab belongs to Crustaceans group")
